to verify our work, please follow the following steps: 
we also have created a youtube video explaining the steps : https://youtu.be/DgxIyHVjh90 


1. change your matlab directory to include this folder

2. open SPcup.m

3. if you want to extract ENF and features from existing data first follow steps 4,5 , if you want to work on extracted ENF skip to step 6.

4. uncomment first section and change the path in first section into the path that includes all training, practice, and test data. 

5. run SPcup.m ; first section labeled "ENF Extraction" takes some minutes, Using FFT with 2^16 number of bits and nonoverlapping windows of 5seconds;
 you can adjust that from the functions but 2^16 is for min acceptable resolution.

6. if you want to just load the already extracted ENF you can leave the first section commented and start running section starting from section 2 in spcup code.

7. please note that sections 2,3 include feature extraction from ENF , features normalization , visualization of normalized features and of Extracted ENF. And that
sections 4,5 include creating classifier and prediction of testing and practice data.

8. please note that sections 6,7 include our work on ENF extraction from our recorded data, similarity analysis 
of our system, and an experiment we designed as an application on audio recording authentication which we apply 
data recorded from our environment and power grids.

9. please note that our trained classifier has little variations when running; every run may cause a variation ov 2% , so to "exactly" reproduce our work that we put in the
 report you can load our saved our best classifier by uncommenting line 80. 

10. to verify the extraction of ENF from our recordings you can download our recorded data at : https://www.dropbox.com/s/kfbu9wwmmmmi0xt/Team_recordings.zip?dl=0&preview=Team_recordings.zip
alternative link : https://www.mediafire.com/?k77sydoe1mr1lyw
, enter the path in which you saved them in line 2 in the function "Extract_Team_recorded_data.m" and uncomment and run the commented line "line number 100"in spcup.m. 


Thank you,
:)
